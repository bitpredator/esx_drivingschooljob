 **Introduction** Hello! Today I want to share with you my first script ever! I haven't seen a script like this on the fivem forum so I decided to make one and to share with you. Hope you like it! 
 
 **What does it do** 
It gives you a chance to become an driving instructor. The instructors can only spawn the vehicle for their category for example if you are car instructor you can spawn only the car. There is aswell an Examiner grade who is the only one who can give licenses for vehicles( the others can give only dmv one).Of course you can change the settings in the client/main.lua file 

  **Features** 
* Spawning vehicle only for your category. 
* Examiners can only give licenses to the others via F6 menu. 
* Billing option which allows the instructors to get money per lesson. * You can add your own work clothes through the database. * You can choose between two languages: English and Bulgarian(of course you can PR in github more  I will include them)
